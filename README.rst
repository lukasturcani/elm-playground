Elm Playground
==============

Just some basic examples and experiments in Elm.

Development environment
-----------------------

To create a development environment, run:

.. code-block:: sh

    npm install

To set up live reloading, run:

.. code-block:: sh

    npm run elm-live -- src/HelloWorld.elm

Instead of ``src/HelloWorld.elm`` you can pass in any Elm module which
has a ``main``.
